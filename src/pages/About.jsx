    <h1>My name is Blake Brittain</h1>
    <p>
      I am a passionate developer who loves to code. I am a proud father of two children, and a lover of all the bully breeds (pit bulls are my favorite). In my free time, I love to get out and take pictures of all things in nature. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me!
